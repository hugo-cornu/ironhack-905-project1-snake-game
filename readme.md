# Snake Game made by Hugo Cornu

## Why I choose this game?

It seemed to be great for DOM and Array manipulation. It also had some complexity with hit collision detections.
Snake is also very playable by definition then I was thinking it could be nice to share it to friends to have feedback from the game and my three-first-weeks learnings.

## Key features

- 100ms setInverval(). It is the snake speed.
- Hit collision 1: When the snake hits the wall.
- Hit collision 2: When the snake reaches its tail.
- The food is getting a new random position on the grid everytime the snake eats it.

## What's next?

- Setup a local "Best Score" as the game is not linked to a database.
- Clean my code and structure it with different JS files.
- Setup different gameplay options like the possibility to go through the wall, put obstacles on the grid or rise/decrease the snake speed.
